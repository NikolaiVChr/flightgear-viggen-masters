\section{Generalities}
All primary displays use electrical power from the secondary AC bus.
The displays are turned on by the yellow top-left button on the TI
(\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:TI}).
In addition, displays are turned on at takeoff when RPM exceeds 90\%.

The HUD requires 40 seconds of preheating after AC power is available, before turning on.
