\section*{The Saab 37 Viggen}
The Saab 37 Viggen is a Swedish, supersonic, single-seat military aircraft,
notable for its short takeoff and landing capability offered by a thrust reverser.
It was developed in the 1960's, entered service in 1971, and was retired in 2005.
While the Viggen was intended as a multi-role aircraft,
it never truly achieved that goal---unlike its successor the JAS 39 Gripen.
Instead, the Viggen was developed into a multitude of versions for different roles:
surface attack (AJ 37), reconnaissance (SF 37, SH 37), and fighter interceptor (JA 37).

\section*{FlightGear Model}
This flight manual is intended for the Saab 37 Viggen model
for the \href{http://www.flightgear.org}{FlightGear} flight simulator.
The model is available through FlightGear's official hangar
\href{http://wiki.flightgear.org/FGAddon}{FGAddon}.
Alternatively, development versions can be found in the Github repository%
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/NikolaiVChr/flightgear-saab-ja-37-viggen}}.
Two variants of the Viggen have been developed in this model:
\begin{description}
  \item[JA 37D] A modernised fighter interceptor version from the 1990's.
    It notably features some of the glass instrument panels used in the JAS 39 Gripen.
  \item[AJS 37] Primarily a surface attack version,
    which resulted out of a modification programme providing some existing Viggens
    with limited multi-role (attack, fighter, and reconnaissance) capabilities.
\end{description}
This version of the manual is for the \variant{}.

\paragraph*{Compatibility Note}
This manual was designed for version \versionnumber{} of the Viggen model.
Minimum supported FlightGear version is 2018.3.x.
Using the latest stable FlightGear version is generally recommended.

\chapter{Instrumentation and Indicators}
\section{Flight Instruments}
\paragraph{Altitude Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:altimeter})}
The long pointer is graduated in 100m, the short one in 1000m.
The indicator can only display altitudes in the range 0--10km, after which it will cycle back to 0.

The knob is used to set reference pressure, which is displayed in hPa on a digital counter.
Pulling the knob (click the center of the knob)
sets the altimeter to the standard reference pressure 1013hPa.
The pressure counter is covered with the text `STD' in this case.

The altimeter requires AC power. A red-white flag indicates power failure.

\paragraph{Airspeed/Mach Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:airspeed})}
The airspeed indicator is graduated in km/h on a pseudo-logarithmic scale,
up to \ifbool{AJS}{1400}{1500}km/h.
The airspeed indicator is fully mechanical.

The digital Mach indicator has a range of M 0--2.5. It is partially covered at M <0.4.
The Mach indicator requires AC power.
A red-white flag indicates power failure of the Mach indicator (but not of the airspeed indicator).

\AJSonly{
  The knob controls an index on the airspeed scale, with no functionality.
}

\ifbool{AJS}{
\paragraph{Heading Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:CI})}
The heading indicator forms a ring around the radar display (CI).
The heading scale ring itself rotates, and is read against a fixed index.
A second yellow moving index indicates bearing to the next waypoint.
The heading indicator requires AC power. A red-white flag indicates power failure.
}{
\paragraph{Heading Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:heading})}
The heading scale itself rotates to indicate aircraft heading, read against a fixed index.
The thin pointer indicates commanded heading, or bearing to the destination.
The wide pointer indicates track angle to the target, or runway direction (at landing).
The heading indicator requires AC power. A red-white flag indicates power failure.

The heading indicator can also display the output of the backup gyrocompass, cf.~\cref{par:backup-heading}.
}

\paragraph{Attitude/Director Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:adi})}
The ADI consists of a sphere which rotates in 3 axes, indicating pitch, roll, and course.
The two flight director needles (horizontal and vertical) show ILS deviation for landing.
The ADI requires AC power. A red flag indicates power failure.

\paragraph{Angle-of-Attack Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:aoa})}
The AoA indicator is graduated in degrees, from -4\textdegree{} to 30\textdegree{}.
When on the ground, the indicator displays pitch angle instead of AoA.
The AoA indicator requires DC power.
In case of power failure, the pointer returns to the -4\textdegree{} position.

\paragraph{Accelerometer (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:gmeter})}
The accelerometer shows G-load (acceleration along the vertical axis), between -2g and +9g.
A second pointer shows the maximum (positive) acceleration reached.
The button resets the maximum acceleration pointer.
The accelerometer is fully mechanical.

\AJSonly{
\paragraph{Clock (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:clock})}
The clock has two scales: the inner one indicates time, and the outer one is used for the stopwatch.
The lower-left knob is used to adjust time.
The top-right button controls the stopwatch.
The first push starts the stopwatch, the second push stops it, and the third push resets it.

\paragraph{Waypoint Distance Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:wpdist})}
Indicates the distance to the next waypoint.
At distances <40km, the scale is graduated in km.
At distances >40km, the scale is graduated in Nordic miles (1mil = 10km), and indicates distances up to 400km.
A small screen indicates the unit in use, as either `km' or `mil'.

\paragraph{Destination Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:wpnum})}
Indicates the type and number of the next waypoint.
The first character indicates waypoint type: B for regular waypoints, L start and landing bases.
The second character indicates waypoint number, or S for the starting base.
}

\section{Backup Instruments}
\paragraph{Backup Altimeter (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:altimeter-bck})}
The long pointer is graduated in 100m, the short one in 1000m.
The indicator can only display altitudes in the range 0--10km, after which it will cycle back to 0.
The knob is used to set reference pressure, which is displayed in hPa on a digital counter.
The backup altimeter is fully mechanical.

\AJSonly{
\paragraph{Backup Airspeed Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:airspeed-bck})}
The backup airspeed indicator is graduated in km/h on a pseudo-logarithmic scale, up to 800km/h.
It is fully mechanical.

\paragraph{Backup Heading Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:heading-bck})}
The backup heading pointer indicates aircraft heading on a fixed scale.
The backup heading indicator requires AC power.
}
\JAonly{
\paragraph{Backup Heading Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:heading-bck-but})}
\label{par:backup-heading}
The JA 37 does not have a separate backup heading indicator.
Instead the main heading indicator can display the output of the backup gyrocompass.
The button BACKUP HEADING (RESERVKURS) toggles this functionality.
When the button light is lit, backup heading is displayed.
The backup gyrocompass requires AC power.
}

\paragraph{Backup Attitude Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:attitude-bck})}
The backup horizon indicates pitch and roll angles.
The display is mechanical, but the gyro uses AC power.
A red-white flag indicates power failure.
The instrument will continue to function with reasonable accuracy for a few minutes after loss of AC power.

\section{Engine Instruments}
\paragraph{RPM Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:rpm})}
The RPM indicator shows high pressure compressor speed (N2), on a scale graduated up to 110\%.
It requires AC power.

\paragraph{Engine Pressure Ratio Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:epr})}
The EPR indicator shows the pressure ratio between the intake and the outlet of the turbine.
It requires AC power.

\paragraph{Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:right-panel}{item:egt})}
The EGT gauge indicates gas temperature after the turbine
(before the afterburner) in \textdegree{}C.
It requires DC power.

\paragraph{Nozzle Position Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:right-panel}{item:nozzle})}
The nozzle indicator shows the position of the engine exhaust nozzle and the current afterburner zone.
It requires DC power.

\paragraph{Afterburner Zone Indicator (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:zone})}
The afterburner zone lights activate to indicate the afterburner zones (1 to 3)
commanded by the throttle lever position.
The lights are commanded purely by the throttle position,
and not the afterburner zones which are actually lit:
for instance moving the throttle in the afterburner zone during thrust reverse
causes the lights to activate, despite afterburner being inhibited during reverse.

\paragraph{Fuel Gauge (\cockpitref{fig:front-panel}{item:fuel})}
The fuel gauge indicates fuel quantity as a percentage.
Under standard conditions, the gauge indicates \ifbool{AJS}{107}{112}\% with full internal tanks,
and \ifbool{AJS}{132}{136}\% with the external tank in addition.
A second black-white pointer indicates required fuel quantity (not implemented).
The fuel gauge requires AC power.

% TODO: https://github.com/NikolaiVChr/flightgear-saab-ja-37-viggen/issues/120
%\section{Course Correction for Magnetic Deviation}
%Like in the real Viggen there are two ways to set the course correction, which makes sure that the instruments show true North instead of magnetic North (e.g. in north Norway the deviation is larger than 12\degree):
%\begin{itemize}
% \item Automatic: Simplified the computer averages the deviation between measured between 110 and 200 km/h during take-off.
% \item Manual: Make sure your airplane is properly aligned with the runway. Press FIXME. The reason for doing it manually is if the runway is slippery or there are strong crosswinds, which might change the way the nose points and therefore give a wrong deviation measurement. 
%\end{itemize}

%Please note that the computer in the real Viggen also makes some comparisons with the stored runway heading(s) to decrease the risk of failures. Warning light \emph{NAV SYST} would lit up. However, this is not modelled in FlightGear.

\section{\variant{} Menu}
The menu \menu{\ifbool{AJS}{AJS-37}{JA-37Di}} contains Viggen-specific dialogs and menus.
The following entries are present.
\begin{description}
  \item[\menu{Select Livery}] There is a variety of liveries available, both historical and fictional.
  \item[\menu{Auto start/stop}] Lets you start and stop the plane without needing to switch switches etc.\ yourself.
    The progress is shown in the top centre of the screen in blue text.
    The final notification of the start-up sequence is `Engine ready'.
    The shut-down sequence is done, when the aircraft is dark.
  \item[\menu{Repair}] Repairs system failures when on the ground.
    In case of a full crash, this option is mostly useless;
    one should restart instead, for instance with \menu{Location>Select Airport}.
  \item[\menu{Fuel/Loadout}] The fuel slider allows quick selection of fuel quantity,
    while ensuring proper fuel balance.
    Fuel quantity is indicated as a percentage, which corresponds to the fuel gauge reading.
    A level of 100\% corresponds slightly less than full internal tanks.

    The loadout selection buttons in the rest of the screen allow
    fast selection of preset historical weapon loadouts.
    The button \menu{Clean loadout} removes any loaded weapon.
    The button \menu{Reload ammo/flares} reloads ammunition
    for guns, rocket pods and bomb racks, as well as flares.

    Compared to the standard dialog \menu{Equipment>Fuel and Payload},
    this dialog is quicker and ensures some realism, but allows less choices.
  \item[\menu{Performance monitor}] Display aircraft performance (mostly for development).
  \item[\menu{Systems monitor}] Display internal status of some systems (mostly for development).
  %\JAonly{\item[\menu{Friends and Foes}] TODO
  %}
  \item[\menu{Toggle external power}] External electrical power, normally used for startup.
    An electrical power truck is shown to the right of the aircraft when enabled.
    Only available when fully stopped.
  \item[\menu{Options}] Viggen specific configuration options, see \cref{sec:options-dialog}.
\end{description}

\section{\variant{} Options}
\label{sec:options-dialog}
The dialog \menu{\ifbool{AJS}{AJS-37}{JA-37Di}>Options} contains the following configuration options.
\begin{description}
  \item[\menu{HUD line width}] Allows to improve HUD visibility if necessary.
  \item[\menu{G-suit quality}] Changes resistance to blackout under high G-load.
  \item[\menu{Cockpit labels in Swedish}] Enable historical Swedish cockpit,
    instead of the English translation.

    The cockpit translation is far from complete: parts of the cockpit will be
    in English, and others in Swedish, regardless of this setting.

    This option is for \emph{physical labels} only,
    and should not be confused with the next one which affects displays.
  \item[\menu{HUD/TI in metric units and Swedish}]
    Change the unit system and language used in displays.  Shortcut: \keys{\shift+I}.

    This option is for \emph{displays} only
    and should not be confused with the previous one which affects physical displays.
\JAonly{
  \item[\menu{TI Display: show non-functional menu items}]
    On the TI display (Horizontal Situation Display),
    show menus non-implemented menus.
  \item[\menu{TI Display: use Internet to fetch map}]
    Enable download of the world map displayed on the TI (Horizontal Situation Display).
}
  \item[\menu{Rust on fuselage}]
    Purely visual. Only available when using the Atmospheric Light Scattering (ALS) FlightGear renderer.
  \item[\menu{Rust in cockpit}]
    Purely visual. Only available when using the Atmospheric Light Scattering (ALS) FlightGear renderer.
  \item[\menu{Enable multiplayer damage}]
    Allows to deal and receive damage from other compatible aircrafts

    This requires \emph{both} involved aircraft to enable damage.

    For fairness, this option can only be toggled when stopped on the ground.
    It also enforces some realism options: blackout, normal simulation speed,
    no external views, and disabling fuel, payload and repair menus while in flight.

Be mindful of failure messages in the TI display FAIL menu, if a gear locking mechanism fails due to being deployed at too high speed, that gear will not be able to support the weight of the aircraft till you repair it from the menu.

\section{Rb 05A missile}
\label{Rb05A}
\begin{figure}[h]

 \caption{AJS 37 with 2 Rb 05A on the inner pylons}
\end{figure}

The Rb 05A was a jam-proof, radio guided super-sonic missile developed in Sweden with similar characteristics as the AGM-65 Maverick. While an optical/IR guidance system was planned, it never got realised because the Maverick was adapted as the Rb 75 instead. The missile was constructed for use against ground and naval targets, but later it was discovered that it could also be used against slow-manoeuvring air targets. 

As the missile was guided visually by the pilot, a smoke free propellant was used and there was a flare in the back. During the first 1.7 seconds of the missile's flight, it was auto guided to fly into the pilot's visual field in front of the aircraft's nose.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/rb_05a_start_popup.png}
 \caption{The Rb 05A is guided automatically into the pilot's view just after the launch.}
\end{figure}

To manually guide the missile in the real Viggen, a mini-joystick on the right console was used with the right hand. Therefore, one of the following was used to free the right hand from the stick:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Take the stick with the left hand and fly the airplane. Reference: [AJS\_2, ch. II, p. 86]
 \item If missile guidance is done during the aircraft flying horizontal, then use autopilot for altitude. If it is done during a light dive, use autopilot for attitude. Reference: [AJS\_3, sec. 7, ch. 5, p. 210]
\end{itemize}

On page 25 in issue 4/1972 of the Swedish magazine \href{https://www.aef.se/Flygvapnet/Tidskrifter/FV_Nytt/Flygvapennytt_1972-4.pdf}{FlygvapenNytt} there is a good description of the capabilities and evolution of the weapon.

Operations (reference: [AJS\_3, sec. 7, ch. 5, p. 210] for description, [AJS\_2, ch. II, p. 86] for procedure):
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Fly fast and low, navigate to the pre-programmed pop-up point in \emph{NAV} mode.
 \item Before reaching the pop-up point:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Correct the atmospheric pressure.
  \item Choose mode \emph{ANF}.
  \item Set the \emph{J/A} weapons knob to Rb 05A with the correct fuse (MARK for ground, SJÖ for naval). Not yet modelled correctly in FlightGear: instead choose the Rb 05A by pressing \keys{w} until displayed on the HUD.
  \item Check that the autopilot is on \emph{SPAK} only.
 \end{itemize}
 \item A fast pop-up is done to 300--400 metres above ground at the pre-programmed pop-up point --- either with pitch only or in a half roll.
 \item Identify the target and fly level or slightly downwards. The nose does not have to point to the target. 
 \item Consider engaging the \emph{ATT} or \emph{ALT} autopilot mode.
 \item Fire within 9 km of the target at a speed between 700 km/h and 1150 km/h.
 \item Guide the missile visually using the collimation principle --- to begin with roughly and then more and more accurate until the missile' flare covers the target.
 \item When the missile has hit the target, evade as quickly as possible and choose \emph{NAV} mode.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/rb_05a_before_impact_ship.png}
 \caption[Flare at back of missile for guidance]{The flare at the back of the missile is used for visual guidance. Here it can be seen just moments before hitting the ship --- clearly off the bore sight and flight path of the aircraft.}
\end{figure}

Operations in FlightGear:
\begin{itemize}
 \item There is no need to lock the target. There is no functionality to set the trigger to unsafe\footnote{In the real Viggen a battery would be activated and the missile would have to be shot within 40 seconds or it would get unusable.}. And there is no specific HUD mode (as in the real Viggen).

 \item Fire with the trigger.
 \item Guide the missile by using one of the following methods:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Use the keybinding \keys{y} to toggle the joystick to be a cursor and then use the usual axis to guide the missile. Note: needs to be done after the trigger has been pressed. To be able to use the joystick for the flight controls again, you need to press \keys{y} again. If the ground collision warning is triggered, then the joystick is automatically set back to control the aircraft again, but you will have lost guidance on the missile.
  \item Bind the following to axis of your joystick or throttle: \textbf{\texttt{/controls/displays/cursor-slew-x}} and \textbf{\texttt{/controls/displays/cursor-slew-y}}. This makes it possible to have different sensitivity from the joystick. Note that it is the same binding as e.g. used in the JA 37Di variant --- but the AJS does not have a screen with a cursor (and the JA 37Di does not have the Rb 05A).
 \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Tips:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Make sure to fly within the recommended speed of 700 km/h--1150 km/h. You might loose sight of the light at the back of the missile and would probably not be able to see the target anyway.
 \item The missile flies for ca. 24 seconds. The max. distance of 9 km can only be reached if the flight path is relatively straight and the aircraft's speed at launch is within the recommended parameters. Therefore, the missile might explode after 24 seconds before it reaches the target, e.g. if the steering commands by the pilot make it swing a lot and thereby loose speed. See also [AJ\_2, ch. 1:6, figure 51, p. 64].
 \item Make sure to fly either straight horizontal or in a light dive. If you have your nose up, you might loose track of the missile and/or target. Note that one of the advantages of this missile is that it can be guided considerable off bore sight.
 \item Especially for large objects (factory) make sure to aim in the middle of the object and on ground level. The proximity fuse might otherwise not recognise it.
 \item Turn off the radar \keys{r} to reduce clutter in the HUD by target symbols.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rb 05A missile}
The Rb 05A could also be used against slow flying air targets like helicopters or transport planes. See section \ref{Rb05A} on page \pageref{Rb05A} for a description. The difference to ground/naval attack is that the distance had to be measured with the radar.

\section{Cannon}
\url{https://www.aef.se/Flygvapnet/Tidskrifter/FV_Nytt/Flygvapennytt_1993-2.pdf} has an article and 2 pictures about the automatic aiming mode for the cannon in the JA version (in Swedish).

\chapter{References}

A comprehensive book in English covering all variants is \glqq Saab 37 Viggen --- The ultimate portfolio\grqq by Jan Jørgensen (published in 2014 by \href{http://www.nordicairpower.com/}{Nordic Airpower}).

\subsection{Original Manuals}
A significant part of the original manuals are available on the internet, and in recent years also many of the formerly classified chapters (as far as the information is not still valid due to (re-)use in the Gripen) have been become available. As the Viggen could not be sold to other countries\footnote{Austrian pilots went through a training programme on the Viggen to familiarise with modern combat airplane, but never bought it}, a significant part of the text and illustrations are in Swedish.

The following manuals are core to the understanding of flying a Viggen in military operations. Where possible, references are made in this manual to text elements in the original manuals(e.g. [AJS\_Del1, sec. 20, ch. 3.4.2, p. 312]). Also, this manual does typically not repeat illustrations from the original handbooks, but shows a screenshot from the simulation instead, so you can compare.
