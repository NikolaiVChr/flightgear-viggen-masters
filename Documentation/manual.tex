\section*{The Saab 37 Viggen}
The Saab 37 Viggen is a Swedish, supersonic, single-seat military aircraft,
notable for its short takeoff and landing capability offered by a thrust reverser.
It was developed in the 1960's, entered service in 1971, and was retired in 2005.
While the Viggen was intended as a multi-role aircraft,
it never truly achieved that goal---unlike its successor the JAS 39 Gripen.
Instead, the Viggen was developed into a multitude of versions for different roles:
surface attack (AJ 37), reconnaissance (SF 37, SH 37), and fighter interceptor (JA 37).

\section*{FlightGear Model}
This flight manual is intended for the Saab 37 Viggen model
for the \href{http://www.flightgear.org}{FlightGear} flight simulator.
The model is available through FlightGear's official hangar
\href{http://wiki.flightgear.org/FGAddon}{FGAddon}.
Alternatively, development versions can be found in the Github repository%
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/NikolaiVChr/flightgear-saab-ja-37-viggen}}.
Two variants of the Viggen have been developed in this model:
\begin{description}
  \item[JA 37D] A modernised fighter interceptor version from the 1990's.
    It notably features some of the glass instrument panels used in the JAS 39 Gripen.
  \item[AJS 37] Primarily a surface attack version,
    which resulted out of a modification programme providing some existing Viggens
    with limited multi-role (attack, fighter, and reconnaissance) capabilities.
\end{description}
This version of the manual is for the \variant{}.

\paragraph*{Compatibility Note}
This manual was designed for version \versionnumber{} of the Viggen model.
Minimum supported FlightGear version is 2020.3.1.
Using the latest stable FlightGear version is generally recommended.

\sidepicture{
  \paragraph{Nozzle Position Indicator (\figref{fig:right-panel}{item:nozzle})}
  The nozzle indicator shows the position of the engine exhaust nozzle and the current afterburner zone.
  It requires DC power.
}{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/instruments/nozzle}}

\sidepicture{
  \paragraph{Afterburner Zone Indicator (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:zone})}
  The afterburner zone lights activate to indicate the afterburner zones (1 to 3)
  commanded by the throttle lever position.
  The lights are commanded purely by the throttle position,
  and not the afterburner zones which are actually lit:
  for instance moving the throttle in the afterburner zone during thrust reverse
  causes the lights to activate, despite afterburner being inhibited during reverse.
}{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/instruments/zone}}

\sidepicture{
  \paragraph{Fuel Gauge (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:fuel})}
  The fuel gauge indicates fuel quantity as a percentage.
  Under standard conditions, the gauge indicates \ifbool{AJS}{107}{112}\% with full internal tanks,
  and \ifbool{AJS}{132}{136}\% with the external tank in addition.
  A second black-white pointer indicates required fuel quantity (not implemented).

\section{Other Indicator Lights}
\paragraph{Master Warning (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:master-warning})}
The master warning consists of two flashing red lights,
\ifbool{AJS}{together with a sound warning.}{sometimes accompanied by a sound warning, depending on the cause.}
It generally lights up together with a blinking light on the warning panels.
Pressing the button between the lights acknowledges the warning,
which causes the corresponding light on the warning panels to become steady.

\paragraph{Reverser (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:rev-light})}
Green light, indicates that the reverser handle
(\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:rev-handle}) is pulled,
and the reverser is armed (but not necessarily active).

\paragraph{Autopilot (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:autopilot})}
Three green pushbuttons/lights.
Used to select one of the autopilot modes: stability assist (STICK/SPAK),
attitude hold (ATT), altitude hold (ALT/HÖJD).
When an autopilot mode is active, the light for it and any lower mode are lit.
The lights can blink to indicate special flight conditions under which the
autopilot is not fully functional.

\paragraph{Autothrottle (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:autothrottle-lights})}
The orange A/T (AFK) light indicates that autothrottle is active.
The pushbutton/light 15,5\textdegree{} is used to select the high-alpha landing mode
(requires landing gear down).

\paragraph{Transonic / Low Speed Reverse(\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:transonic})}
Yellow light, indicates that the aircraft is in the transonic regime.

On the ground, it instead indicates that the reverser is active at low airspeed,
causing a risk of hot air ingestion and engine fire.
A low throttle setting (EPR<1.4) should be maintained in this case.

\AJSonly{
\paragraph{Weapon Released (\figref{fig:front-panel}{item:release})}
When using Rb 04, Rb 15, and m/71, a steady light indicates that the weapon release sequence is complete.
The light goes off when securing the trigger safety.

A blinking light indicates that a weapon was not properly released.

\begin{description}
  \item[FK/TST] Built-in test. Not implemented (does the same as BER/PRE).
  \item[BER/PRE] Standby mode used for start-up and taxi.  Displays (HUD and CI) are turned off.
  \item[NAV] Navigation mode. Used during most of the flight, including takeoff.
  \item[ANF/CBT] Combat mode. See \cref{chap:weapons}.
  \item[SPA/REC] Reconnaissance mode. Not implemented (does the same as NAV).
  \item[LANDING NAV] Instruments landing mode.
    Enables landing guidance using inertial navigation and ILS,
    provided the destination is set in the route manager.
  \item[LANDING P/O] Visual landing mode.
\end{description}

A typical flight may use the following modes.
Initially, the mode is BER/PRE.
Shortly before takeoff (when entering the runway), the mode is switched to NAV.
In order to use weapons, the mode is switched to ANF/CBT,
then back to NAV when resuming normal flight.

LANDING mode is typically selected within 20km of the destination.
LANDING NAV mode will give indications to follow a full approach pattern,
and enables ILS guidance for final, if available.
LANDING P/O simply gives indicates runway heading and nominal glide slope on the HUD, for visual landing.
One can also begin the approach in LANDING NAV mode,
and later switch to LANDING P/O to finish the approach visually.

For the LANDING NAV mode, the approach pattern can be changed
by the following operations (called `flip-flop').
\begin{itemize}
  \item Switching to LANDING P/O, then back to LANDING NAV select the short approach mode,
    with a 10km final instead of a 20km final.
  \item Switching to NAV, then back to LANDING NAV
    starts a new approach pattern, with a long (20km) final.
    (NAV can be replaced by any non-landing mode).

  and in the UHF band 225.000--399.950 MHz with 50KHz spacing.
  It can use 762 programmable channels, as well as direct frequency input.

  The FR 24 operates in the VHF band 110.000--147.000 MHz with 50KHz,

  The \variant{} is equipped with two communication radios.

  The FR 29 primary radio operates in the VHF band 103.000--159.975 MHz
  and in the UHF band 225.000--399.975 MHz, both with 25KHz spacing.
  It consists of two FR 28 transceivers, called A and B.
  At all time, one transceiver is used for voice communication, while the other is used for data link.
  Transceiver B (unlike A) can be powered by the aircraft battery,
  and should thus be used when AC power is unavailable,
  on the ground before startup or in case of electrical failure.
  The FR 29 can use 934 programmable channels, as well as direct frequency input.

  The FR 31 secondary radio operates in the VHF band 104.000--161.975 MHz

\subsection{Radio Channels}
The different Viggen radios can use a number of configurable radio channels.
Available channel names are the following.
\begin{description}
  \item[Generic channels] These channels are normally used to communicate between aircrafts, and with fighter control.
    Their name consists of 3 digits.
    \ifbool{AJS}{%
      Channels 010 to 419 can be used.
    }{%
      The FR 29 can use channels 000 to 429, and the FR 31 can use channels 000 to 119.
    }
  \item[Airbase channels] These channels are normally used to communicate with ATC.
    Their name consists of an airbase number (2 digits),
    followed by one of the letters A,B,C,C2,D.
    \ifbool{AJS}{%
      Airbase numbers 01 to 69 can be used.
    }{%
      The FR 29 can use airbase numbers 00 to 99, and the FR 31 can use airbase numbers 000 to 169
      (airbase numbers have an additional leading digit on the FR 31).
    }
  \item[Guard channel] The international guard channel 121.5MHz, called channel H.
  \item[Global channels] Three fixed, global channels, called E,F,G\JAonly{ (unavailable on the FR 31)}.
  \item[Others] \ifbool{AJS}{%
      The FR 22 has three unlabelled channel buttons, nicknamed S1,S2,S3 in this manual.
    }{%
      The FR 29 has two programmable channels called M,L.
    }
\end{description}

These channels (except for guard channel H) are defined in text configuration files,
which can be loaded through \menu{\variant{}>Load radio channels}.
Configuration file syntax is described in \directory{Aircraft/JA37/Doc/channels-example.txt}.
By default the file \directory{Aircraft/JA37/Nasal/radios/channels-default.txt} is loaded.


\JAonly{
  \subsection{Data Link}
  Data link is used to communicate data such as position of friendly aircrafts
  and of targets with ground control (STRIL) and between fighters (fighter link).
  A very limited part of fighter link is implemented, allowing aircrafts to share their position,
  and the position of aircrafts they are tracking.
  This information is displayed on the TI.

  Datalink is activated with the DL button in the SYST page on the TI.
  The KV3 screen (\figref{fig:kv1}{item:kv3-display}) is used to set the datalink channel
  on the last 3 digits, and a datalink identifier on the first digit.
  Aircrafts must be on the same datalink channel to communicate.
  The identifier helps to distinguish between aircrafts on a same datalink channel.
  Each aircraft should set it to a different number, (e.g.\ its position in the formation).
  The identifier is ignored if it is 0.

  \newcommand{\dlfriend}{%
    \begin{tikzpicture}%
      \draw (0,0) -- (0,1ex) -- (0.625ex,1.875ex) -- (1.25ex,1ex) -- (1.25ex,0) -- (0,0);
      \draw (0.625ex,0) -- (0.625ex,0.875ex);
    \end{tikzpicture}%
  }
  \newcommand{\dltarget}{%
    \begin{tikzpicture}%
      \draw (0,1ex) circle (1ex);
      \draw (0,0.5ex) circle (0.5ex);
    \end{tikzpicture}%
  }

  On the TI, an aircraft connected through datalink shows
  as a green \dlfriend{} with its identifier below it, if any.
  Furthermore, an aircraft A connected through datalink
  may transmit information about an aircraft B which it is tracking.
  Then, aircraft B is displayed as \dltarget{} with the identifier of A below it, if any.
}


\section{Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)}
\label{sec:iff}
IFF is a radar system designed to identify friendly aircrafts.%
\footnote{%
  Despite the name, IFF can by no mean identify foes.
  An enemy aircraft is undistinguishable from e.g.\ a civilian aircraft,
  or an aircraft with a non-functioning IFF system.
}
Each aircraft can set a \emph{query code} for its IFF system,
and aircrafts with the same query code set will be identified as friendly.
Thus, allied aircrafts can identify each other by using a shared code, chosen before the mission.
In FlightGear, other aircrafts with a compatible IFF system include the F-16
and Justin Nicholson's MiG-21\footnote{\url{https://github.com/l0k1/MiG-21bis}}.

\AJSonly{
The AJS variant of the Viggen is only equipped with the transponder part of the IFF system:
it can be identified by other aircrafts, but can not identify them.

  \paragraph{Control Panel}
  The IFF control panel \figref{fig:right-panel}{item:iff}
  is located on the rear right side of the cockpit.
  The right knob is the power knob, with 3 positions: OFF/FRÅN, AUTO (on when airborne), ON/TILL.

\JAonly{
\paragraph{Identification of Contacts}
IFF interrogation is done with \keys{N}, and lasts 10 seconds, during which the IK light on the MI frame is lit.
The IFF radar is a secondary radar physically tied to the primary radar,
which will interrogate any contact in the primary radar search area.
Friendly responses are displayed with a cross on the MI.

For any tracked radar contact, the IFF response or lack thereof is stored, as long as tracking is maintained.
It is displayed on the HUD and the TI with a cross over friendly contacts.
Additionally, the TI uses a color code: green for friendly contacts,
red for contacts which failed to answer an IFF interrogation,
and yellow for contacts which were not interrogated.
The IFF information displayed on the TI and HUD can also use information transmitted by other aircrafts on datalink.

\paragraph{Friendly Callsigns}
The menu \menu{JA-37Di>Friends (IFF)} allows to set a list of friendly callsigns.
Aircrafts with these callsigns will always be identified as friendly by IFF,
even if they do not have the same IFF query code.
This allows to operate with other aircrafts which do not have a compatible IFF system.

    This means that these weapons are mutually exclusive (they can not be loaded together).
    See \cref{sec:loadout} for more details.
  \item Position IR-RB is an exception: different types of sidewinders can be loaded together,
    and are selected simultaneously by this position.
    Use button IR-RB FRAMSTEGN (\figref{fig:left-panel}{item:ir-framstegn}) to cycle pylons.
  \item The different bomb aiming modes are not implemented. Only a generic CCIP exists.
  \item Rb 05 MARK and SJÖ modes differ only by the fuse setting, which is not implemented.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Wingspan and Bomb Interval Selector}
This knob (\figref{fig:wpn-panel}{item:dist-sel}) is used to set the bomb release interval,
and the target wingspan for the HUD in A/A aiming modes. It is graduated in meters from 10m to 60m.
The three leftmost positions (VÄ, RAKT, HÖ) are used for illumination bombs, which are not implemented.

\paragraph{Sequence Release and ARAK Long Range Mode}
The switch SERIE/IMPULS (\figref{fig:wpn-panel}{item:impuls})
has different functions depending on the selected weapon.
\begin{description}
  \item[Rb 04 / Rb 15] The switch controls sequence release.
    In position SERIE, both missiles are launched with 2 second interval.
    In position IMPULS, only one missile is launched at a time.
  \item[ARAK] The switch controls long range aiming mode.
    In position SERIE, the normal aiming mode is used.
    In position IMPULS, a long range standoff aiming mode is used.
    It allows firing at up to 7km from the target, but with reduced accuracy and more restrictive aiming conditions.
\end{description}
Despite the label, this switch has no functionality for bombs
(it is only used for training bombs, which are not implemented).

%\section{Course Correction for Magnetic Deviation}
%Like in the real Viggen there are two ways to set the course correction, which makes sure that the instruments show true North instead of magnetic North (e.g. in north Norway the deviation is larger than 12\degree):
%\begin{itemize}
% \item Automatic: Simplified the computer averages the deviation between measured between 110 and 200 km/h during take-off.
% \item Manual: Make sure your airplane is properly aligned with the runway. Press FIXME. The reason for doing it manually is if the runway is slippery or there are strong crosswinds, which might change the way the nose points and therefore give a wrong deviation measurement. 
%\end{itemize}

%Please note that the computer in the real Viggen also makes some comparisons with the stored runway heading(s) to decrease the risk of failures. Warning light \emph{NAV SYST} would lit up. However, this is not modelled in FlightGear.

\subsection{Radar Stick Controls}
\label{sec:cursor}
The radar stick is used to control the cursor on the \ifbool{AJS}{CI}{MI and TI}.
There are three ways to control it:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Enable the option \menu{\ifbool{AJS}{AJS-37}{JA-37Di}>Options>Arrow keys control radar cursor},
    and use the arrow keys to move the cursor, \keys{\return} to click/select.
  \item Add joystick bindings to control the cursor.
    This can be done under \menu{File>Joystick Configuration},
    the controls are named \menu{Cursor Horizontal}, \menu{Cursor Vertical}, and \menu{Cursor Click}.
    Alternatively, manually edit joystick configuration files to bind the properties
    \begin{alltt}
/controls/displays/cursor-slew-x
/controls/displays/cursor-slew-y
/controls/displays/cursor-click\end{alltt}
  \item Press \keys{Y} to use the main flight controls
    (joystick, mouse, arrow keys, whatever you use to control the aircraft)
    to instead control the cursor.
    In this mode, elevator and aileron controls are used to move the cursor.
    Normal flight controls are restored by pressing \keys{Y} again.
    A ground collision warning will also immediately restore normal flight controls.

    Consider using autopilot when controlling the cursor in this way.
\end{itemize}

In all cases, \keys{L} can also be used to click.

\AJSonly{%
  The same controls are used to move and lock the Rb 75 seeker,
  and to fly the Rb 05A remote controlled missile.
}

\section{\variant{} Menu}
The menu \menu{\ifbool{AJS}{AJS-37}{JA-37Di}} contains Viggen-specific dialogs and menus.
The following entries are present.
\begin{description}
  \item[\menu{Manual (open in browser)}] Open this manual in a browser or PDF reader.
  \item[\menu{Select Livery}] There is a variety of liveries available, both historical and fictional.
  \item[\menu{Auto start/stop}] Lets you start and stop the plane without needing to switch switches etc.\ yourself.
    The progress is shown in the top centre of the screen in blue text.
    The final notification of the start-up sequence is `Engine ready'.
    The shut-down sequence is done, when the aircraft is dark.
  \item[\menu{Repair}] Repairs system failures.
    In case of a full crash, this option is of limited use;
    one should restart instead with \menu{File>Reset}.
\AJSonly{\item[\menu{Ground Crew Panel}] Ground crew weapon panel.}
  \item[\menu{Performance monitor}] Display aircraft performance (mostly for development).
  \item[\menu{Systems monitor}] Display internal status of some systems (mostly for development).
  \item[\menu{Combat log}] Multiplayer damage log (damage dealt and received).
  \item[\menu{Load radio channels}] Load configuration files for programmable radio channels.
\JAonly{\item[\menu{Friends (IFF)}] Allows to set a list of friendly callsigns for IFF (cf.\ \cref{sec:iff}).}
  \item[\menu{Toggle chocks}] Parking chocks. Only available when fully stopped.
  \item[\menu{Toggle external power}] External electrical power, normally used for startup.
    An electrical power truck is shown to the right of the aircraft when enabled.
    Only available when fully stopped.
  \item[\menu{Options}] Viggen specific configuration options, see \cref{sec:options-dialog}.
\end{description}


\section{\variant{} Options}
\label{sec:options-dialog}
The dialog \menu{\ifbool{AJS}{AJS-37}{JA-37Di}>Options} contains the following configuration options.
\begin{description}
  \item[\menu{Head shaking}] Head shaking during ground roll and at high alpha.
    May conflict with other view control scripts, e.g.\ headtracking.
  \item[\menu{Cockpit labels in Swedish}] Enable historical Swedish cockpit,
    instead of the English translation.
    (Cockpit translation is incomplete.)
\JAonly{

    This option is for \emph{physical labels} only, and should not be confused
    with the next one which affects displays.
  \item[\menu{HUD/TI in metric units and Swedish}]
    Change the unit system and language used in displays.  Shortcut: \keys{\shift+I}.

    This option is for \emph{displays} only, and should not be confused with
    the previous one which affects physical labels.
  \item[\menu{TI: show non-functional menu items}]
    On the TI (HSD), show non-implemented menus.
  \item[\menu{TI Display: use Internet to fetch map}]
    Enable download of the world map displayed on the TI (HSD).
}
\AJSonly{
  \item[\menu{Ground radar quality}]
    Adjusts the resolution of the AJS ground radar. This significantly affects performances.
  \item[\menu{Automatic ground crew weapon panel settings}]
    Automatically adjust ground crew weapon panel for current loadout.
}
  \item[\menu{Arrow keys control radar cursor}]
    When enabled, the arrow keys will control the radar stick to move the
    cursor on the different displays, and \keys{\return} is used to `click'
    (select the target under the cursor, or other depending on context).

    When disabled, the arrow keys are used for elevator and aileron,
    and \keys{\return} is used for rudder (FlightGear default behaviour).
    Cf.\ \cref{sec:cursor} for more details regarding cursor controls.
  \item[\menu{Enable multiplayer damage}]
    Allows to deal and receive damage from other compatible aircrafts
    (other Viggens, F-14, F-15, F-16, M-2000, MiG-21, etc.) in multiplayer.
    This requires \emph{both} involved aircraft to enable damage.

    For fairness, this option can only be toggled when stopped on the ground.
    It also enforces some realism options: blackout, normal simulation speed,
    no external views, and disabling fuel, payload, repair, and combat log menus while in flight.

\section{Loadout Restrictions}
\label{sec:loadout}
While the AJS 37 has access to a wide variety of weapons, they can not all be loaded at the same time.
The following restrictions apply:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{rule:unique} Only one type of primary weapon can be loaded at any time.
  \item Primary weapons are everything except IR missiles (Rb 24, Rb 24J, and Rb 74 Sidewinders).
    Any combination of IR missiles can be loaded in addition to the primary weapons.
  \item There is an exception to rule~\ref{rule:unique}:
    AKAN gun pods can be loaded together with either Rb 05 or Rb 75 missiles
    (but not Rb 05 and Rb 75 together).
\end{enumerate}

Loading weapons which violate these restrictions triggers a warning text message,
and will result in \emph{all} weapons being unusable.

In the \menu{Equipment > Fuel and Payload} dialog,
the \menu{Loadout Presets} allows to quickly load several combinations of weapons,
and gives a good overview of the allowed loadouts.
}

\section{General Procedures}
The generic weapon employment procedure is the following.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select weapon type with%
    \ifbool{AJS}{
      the weapon selector knob (\keys{C} / \keys{\shift+C}), cf.\ \cref{sec:weapon-panel}.
      Alternatively, press \keys{U} for A/A missiles quick selection.
    }{
      \keys{C} (A/A missiles), \keys{\shift+C} (cannon), or through the TI.
    }
  \ifbool{AJS}{
  \item Set main mode selector to ANF/CBT
    (\figref{fig:left-panel}{item:main-mode}, \keys{M} / \keys{\shift+M}).
  }{
  \item If desired, engage aiming mode with \keys{H}.
  }
  \item \ifbool{AJS}{Depending on the weapon type,}{For missiles,} lock on to the target.
  \item Open trigger safety with \keys{\shift+E} to arm the selected weapon.
  \item Fire the weapon with \keys{E}. \JAonly{Press and hold for ca.~1 second to fire missiles.}
  \item Secure the trigger with \keys{\shift+E}.
\end{enumerate}

Remarks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Upon switching to \ifbool{AJS}{mode ANF/CBT}{aiming mode},
    the HUD changes to a weapon-specific aiming presentation.
    \AJSonly{For the Rb 04, Rb 15, Rb 05, and m/90,
    this aiming mode is the same as the usual navigation HUD.}
  \item It is possible to fire \ifbool{AJS}{in mode NAV instead of ANF/CBT}{without using the aiming mode}.
    In this case, \ifbool{AJS}{the aiming presentation}{a simplified aiming presentation}
    is engaged when opening the trigger safety.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trigger Safety Usage}
The trigger safety role is not just to prevent unintentional fire.
It is an important part of the fire control system as it arms the weapon.
Improper use of trigger safety will prevent weapon usage.

General guidelines are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only open the trigger safety once the target is in sight / on radar,
    and the decision to engage it has been made.
  \item Only open the trigger safety after the desired weapon is selected.
    If a new weapon is selected while the trigger is unsafe, the new weapon
    will not be armed (until the trigger is secured and unsecured again).
  \item Secure the trigger shortly after firing.
  \item When firing several missiles in succession, the trigger must be secured between each weapon.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{References}

A comprehensive book in English covering all variants is \glqq Saab 37 Viggen --- The ultimate portfolio\grqq by Jan Jørgensen (published in 2014 by \href{http://www.nordicairpower.com/}{Nordic Airpower}).

\subsection{Original Manuals}
A significant part of the original manuals are available on the internet, and in recent years also many of the formerly classified chapters (as far as the information is not still valid due to (re-)use in the Gripen) have been become available. As the Viggen could not be sold to other countries\footnote{Austrian pilots went through a training programme on the Viggen to familiarise with modern combat airplane, but never bought it}, a significant part of the text and illustrations are in Swedish.

The following manuals are core to the understanding of flying a Viggen in military operations. Where possible, references are made in this manual to text elements in the original manuals(e.g. [AJS\_Del1, sec. 20, ch. 3.4.2, p. 312]). Also, this manual does typically not repeat illustrations from the original handbooks, but shows a screenshot from the simulation instead, so you can compare.
